# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

Requires node.js and git. An IDE like Visual Studio Code is recommended.

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Updating Pages

All pages are generated from the `/docs` directory and uses [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
