## Brush Care

### Cleaning Station Set Up

1. Lay out small tarp
2. Lay out some cardboard
3. Fill three buckets with water and place on tarp

### Cleaning

1. Use spatulas to squeeze excess paint out of brushes and drop in bucket 1 to soak (about 10 mins).

2. Take brushes out of bucket 1 and place in bucket 2. Use combs to get stuck paint out of bristles and use scrubbers to take any caked off paint off of outside of brushes.

3. Take brushes out of bucket 2 and place in bucket three to squeeze out any remaining paint.

4. Set brushes out on cardboard or tarp to dry.

### Maintenance

- Soak brushes in mineral oil once or twice a year to help keep them in good shape.

- Weed out old/bad brushes once a year.
