## Tifo Lead Appointment Process

1. Two nomination options:

    a. Someone is nominated by an existing tifo lead or

    b. Someone asks to be a tifo lead (self-nomination)

    Existing tifo leads will advertise the opportunity to become a tifo lead at regular tifo meetings as well as regularly in the `#team-tifo` Slack channel.

2. Ask Membership Committee/SXI for a recommendation on whether to proceed with the evaluation process for the candidate.
3. For nominations made by existing tifo leads: Solicit comments from all existing tifo leads & hold a pass/fail majority vote on whether to reach out to the nominee and continue the process. 

    This can take place at a regularly scheduled team tifo meeting or at a special meeting called for the purpose of discussing tifo lead candidates.

4. Assign 2 tifo leads to be points of contact for the nominee during the nomination process.
5. Tifo lead points of contact will reach out to the tifo lead candidate with job description, process info, etc., and gauge that nominee’s interest (there is time to change their mind - this is an initial interest measure).
6. Trial period on next tifo - the candidate becomes a trial lead.

    Includes access to storage, project channel.

7. Final decision - Existing leads will vote on whether to offer lead position to the candidate either at the regular team tifo meeting or in a specially called leads meeting.
8. Present decision to candidate.

    If we say no, it is best practice but not required to have documented reasons for the rejection that can be provided to the candidate.

9. There is no formal appeals process, but candidates who are rejected may nominate themselves again after one year.
